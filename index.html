   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>
    This section provides information about you or your website. <br/>
    For the past 6 years I have juggled working full time as a Bio Medical Engineer, <br/>
    persuring my dream of graduating college and breaking barriers when it comes to physical challanges.<br/>
    What first started as a small goal slowly changed my entire outlook on life.
